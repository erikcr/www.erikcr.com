# Intro 

Looking back, my journey into filmmaking was quite the adventure filled with twists, turns, and valuable lessons learned. It all started with a passion project that kicked open the door to bigger opportunities down the road.

## Cutting My Teeth on the 7 Day Shootout

My first foray into film landed me on a team for the Knoxville Film Festival's 7 Day Shootout. Having never worked on an actual short film before, I didn't have much to offer besides some minor editing experience from personal vlogs and school projects. But the team was in need of an editor, so I took the plunge. 

Those 7 days tested the limits of my stamina as we wrote, shot, and edited a 5-minute short film titled "The Exchange Student". Fueled by coffee and determination, I pieced together a cohesive narrative from the footage we captured. The premiere screening marked my transition from dabbling in editing to truly embracing the craft.

## Testing My Mettle with a 15-Second Short 

Soon after arriving in Ireland, I decided to flex my filmmaking muscles by creating a 15-second short inspired by Sundance's 15-second Film Challenge. Without a team to lean on, I single-handedly served as writer, director, cinematographer, actor, and editor.  

Let's just say the final product was a bit rough around the edges. But staring at a blank page forces creativity, and creativity breeds growth. This micro-short lit a spark within me to improve.

## Trial by Fire on My First Real Set 

Eager to network with fellow film enthusiasts, I joined Facebook groups and attended meetups in Dublin. One day I saw a post seeking crew for a project starting the next morning. I reached out, and the director responded at 6 AM on the day filming commenced. 

What transpired could only be described as organized chaos. The writer/director/producer lacked experience coordinating a film production from start to finish. We fell further behind schedule each day as 12+ hour shoots became the norm. 

The project itself may have been a mess, but the connections made were invaluable. I bonded with talented creatives and witnessed firsthand what _not_ to do when managing a film set.

## Finding Community with Dublin Filmmakers  

Craving a consistent creative community, I turned to a weekly meetup called Dublin Filmmakers. At my first gathering, roles were being assigned for their annual Christmas film. Most positions were filled, but I managed to snag a camera operator role, my first gig with the group.

Collaborating with Dublin Filmmakers became a pillar of my growth. I established lasting friendships and worked on too many projects to count. It felt good to have a team that valued organization, communication, and creativity in equal measure.

## My Foray Into Star Wars Fan Films

A friend from the group approached me about helping on a Star Wars fan film he had written. I was instantly onboard. However, none of us owned a car, so we hauled all the camera gear plus costumes and props via public transportation deep into the Irish countryside where we shot.

Maintaining a schedule proved nearly impossible with so many moving parts. We often lost sunlight waiting on late cast and crew members. I failed to properly apply lessons from past mishaps and had to learn things the hard way. But at least the final film looked pretty cool!

## Hitting My Stride Editing "An Indecent Proposal" 

My biggest sense of accomplishment came while editing a drama called "An Indecent Proposal". Though I missed the on-set filming due to schedule conflicts, I relished the chance to cut together the footage. I worked closely with the director over multiple editing passes to achieve the desired tone and pacing. 

As a final flourish, I also handled the color grading, aligning each scene visually with the emotional beats of the narrative. Premiere night, seeing my name in the credits as editor, filled me with pride in how far I'd come.

# Reflection

My introduction to filmmaking happened organically through a string of opportunities that steadily nurtured my passion. With each new project, I expanded my skills and forged connections with likeminded creatives. Though the road had bumps and missteps along the way, those stumbles taught me invaluable lessons. Most importantly, I learned that creating a great film requires meticulous planning, clear communication, and a cohesive team.
