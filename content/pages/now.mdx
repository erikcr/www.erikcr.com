# What I'm doing now

(This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and if you have your own site, you should make one, too.)

Updated October 16, 2023 from Hermiston, OR.

## Finally back on the road

After having been "stranded" in Seattle for the better part of 2 months waiting on repairs to the Highlander, I'm now back on the road. I'm currently traveling with friends as we make our way through Utah, Colorado, Texas, and then ending up back in Tennessee.

We are planning stops in Zion Natl Park and Moab, along with a Halloween themed event in southern Utah. I need to be in Houston by mid-Noverber for a wedding and then we will get back to TN for Thanksgiving.
